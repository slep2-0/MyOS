# MatanelOS Kernel

![DEVELOPMENT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-DEVELOPMENT,_STABLE-purple?style=for-the-badge)

MatanelOS is a 64-bit SMP Compatible Operating System built from scratch, inspired by Windows kernel architecture. It features preemption, IRQLs, DPCs, paging, dynamic memory, and a fully-fledged VFS (currently FAT32), and a scheduler that supports multiprocessing. This project is for educational purposes and low-level OS experimentation.
